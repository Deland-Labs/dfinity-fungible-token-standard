Feature: token tx auto scaling storage

  Background:
    Given Reinstall dft canisters
      | key       | name         | symbol | decimals | total_supply | fee_minimum | fee_rate | rate_decimals | owner    |
      | dft_basic | Test Token 1 | TST1   | 18       | 100000000    | 0.01        | 0        | 8             | dft_main |
    And owner "dft_main" set "dft_fee_charger" as fee_to
    And transfer token from "dft_main" to these users
      | token     | user      | amount  |
      | dft_basic | dft_miner | 1000000 |
      | dft_basic | dft_user1 | 1000000 |
      | dft_basic | dft_user2 | 1000000 |
      | dft_basic | dft_user3 | 1000000 |

  Scenario:Auto scaling storage when tx count is more than 3000 times
    When Check the storage canisters count is equal to "0" ,by "dft_main"
    Then Transfer token repeat "3010" times
      | token     | from      | to        |
      | dft_basic | dft_main  | dft_miner |
      | dft_basic | dft_miner | dft_user1 |
      | dft_basic | dft_user1 | dft_user2 |
      | dft_basic | dft_user2 | dft_user3 |
      | dft_basic | dft_user3 | dft_main  |
    Then Check the storage canisters count is equal to "1" ,by "dft_main"
    Then Check the block height "2004" transfer transaction of "dft_basic", the amount should be 1998
    Then Check the block height "999" transfer transaction of "dft_basic", the result should be a forward result
    Then Get the block height "999" transfer transaction of "dft_basic" from archive canister, the amount should be "993"
    Then Check the block height "2010" transfer transaction of "dft_basic", the result should not be a forward result
    Then Check the blocks query of "dft_basic", start block height "3014",size "2", check each transaction is correct
      | amount | fee  |
      | 3008   | 0.01 |
      | 3009   | 0.01 |
    Then Check token "dft_basic"'s archives ,should be
      | start | end  |
      | 0     | 1999  |

  Scenario: Update token logo
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s logo "TICP.png" with owner "dft_main", will success
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s logo with invalid image data with owner "dft_main", will failed
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s logo with not owner "dft_user1", will failed

  Scenario: Update token description with not owner will failed
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s description with not owner "dft_user1", will failed

      | key      | value         |
      | DSCVR    | test dscvr    |
      | OPENCHAT | test openchat |
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s description by "dft_main",will include blow fields and values

      | DSCVR       | test dscvr5 |
      | UNKNOWNKYE1 | unknown1    |
      | UNKNOWNKYE1 | unknown1    |
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s description will not contain "UNKNOWNKYE1" and "UNKNOWNKYE2" by "dft_main"
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s description by "dft_main",will include blow fields and values

  Scenario: Update token fee
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s fee with owner "dft_main", will success
      | minimum | rate | rate_decimals |
      | 0.001   | 0.1  | 8             |
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s fee by "dft_main",will include blow fields and value
      | minimum | rate | rate_decimals |

    When I update token "dft_basic"'s fee with not owner "dft_user1", will failed
      | minimum | rate | rate_decimals |
      | 0.001   | 0.1  | 8             |

  Scenario: Update token fee twice, the second will fail
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s fee with owner "dft_main" twice, the second will fail
      | minimum | rate | rate_decimals |
      | 0.001   | 0.1  | 8             |
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s fee by "dft_main",will include blow fields and value
      | minimum | rate | rate_decimals |
      | 0.001   | 0.1  | 8             |

  Scenario: Update token fee with passed 1 days will fail
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s fee with owner "dft_main" with passed "1" days, will failed
      | minimum | rate | rate_decimals |
      | 0.001   | 0.99 | 8             |
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s fee by "dft_main",will include blow fields and value
      | minimum | rate | rate_decimals |
      | 0.01    | 0    | 8             |

  Scenario: Update token feeTo
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s feeTo as "dft_user1" with owner "dft_main", will success
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s feeTo by "dft_main", should be "dft_user1"
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s feeTo as "dft_user2" with not owner "dft_user1", will failed

  Scenario: Update token feeTo twice, the second will fail
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s feeTo as "dft_user1" with owner "dft_main" twice, the second will fail
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s feeTo by "dft_main", should be "dft_user1"

  Scenario: Update token feeTo with passed 1 days will fail
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s feeTo as "dft_user1" with owner "dft_main" with passed "1" days, will failed
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s feeTo by "dft_main", should be "dft_main"

  Scenario: Update token owner
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s owner to "dft_user1" with owner "dft_main", will success
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s owner by "dft_main", should be "dft_user1"
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s to "dft_user1" owner with not owner "dft_user2", will failed
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s owner by "dft_main", should be "dft_user1"

  Scenario: Update token owner with passed 1 days will fail
    When I update token "dft_basic"'s owner to "dft_user1" with owner "dft_main" with passed "1" days, will failed
    Then Get token "dft_basic"'s owner by "dft_main", should be "dft_main"
